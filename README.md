Early explorations with HTML through Odin Project

This project will require use of various HTML skills learned so far to build a basic recipe website.  It will have a main index page with links to a few recipes.  It will not likely look very nice, because we haven't learned any css skills yet, but it should function properly.  

Once the project is finished, I may come back to edit this description to detail the skills I used to create it.
