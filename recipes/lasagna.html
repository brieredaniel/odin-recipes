    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preheating the oven to 375 degrees. </li>
        <li>Combine pasta ingredients and knead to make dough.  Texture should be smooth, pliable, and firm.  Roll into a ball and wrap in cello until ready to roll into noodles.</li>
        <li>Make Bolognese.  Melt anchovies in a splash of olive oil on medium-high heat, then add diced onions and garlic.  Add ground meat, carrots and celery.  Stir until meat <br>is browned, then cover for 3 minutes, until onions and celery begin to become soft.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add crushed tomatoes, a splash of balsamic vinegar, stir, <br>and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat, let simmer for 30 min. </li>
        <li>Make Bechamel.  Melt butter over medium heat, add flour and milk alternately, in small amounts.  Once a nice sauce has formed, season with salt and nutmeg. </li>
        <li>Put a large pot of water on to boil--heavily seasoned with salt--while you make the noodles.  Uncover the ball of past dough, and roll it out into thin sheets. This can <br>be done by hand, or with a pasta maker, or a combination of both.  Cut sheets into 8 inch lengths, then drop the pasta into the boiling water.  When the noodles float after <br>90 seconds or so, remove them and pat them dry with paper towel. </li>
        <li>Assemble the lasgna in pyrex baking dish.  Start with a thin layer of sauce, then layer noodles to cover the bottom of the dish.  Alternate bolognese, ricotta, noodles, <br>bechamel, parmesan, noodles, etc.  Top liberally with mozzarella and parmesan, and sprinkle fresh herbs for garnish.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminium foil and bake in the oven for 45 minutes.  In the last 10 minutes, remove foil to brown mozza and crisp the edges. </li>
        <li>Allow lasagna to cool for 15 minutes or so before serving.  And enjoy!</li>
