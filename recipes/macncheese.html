        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>You thought I was going to detail a nice homemade recipe here didn't you?  Haha, well joke's on you sucker.  Here's how to make KD.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A box of KD</li>
            <li>Some Butter</li>
            <li>Some Milk</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper, if you're fancy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pretty big pot and fill it with 6 cups water, then set it on the stove on high heat to boil.  If you're fancy, season the water with a bunch of salt to make the noodles tastier.  <br>Not necessary though, because the cheese sauce should do the heavy lifting there.  Note: The bigger the pot the better, which will stop the pasta from boiling over.</li>
            <li>Once the pot of water is boiling, open up the package of KD, carefully remove the sauce packet, and pour the noodles into the boiling water.  Give em a good stir so they don't stick to <br>the bottom of the pot, and a bit of butter as well.  The fat from the butter will again help the pasta from boiling over.  Set timer for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the timer goes off, turn off the stove, drain the pasta by pouring through a sieve in the sink.  Return the cooked pasta to the pot, swirling it to keep the pasta from sticking. </li>
            <li>Add a bit of butter, a splash of milk, and empty the sauce packet into the pot.  Put the pot back onto the same element, which is now turned off.  (The residual heat should be enough <br>keep the pasta warm.)  Stir to combine until the sauce is consistent and there are no clumps of powder or butter.  </li>
            <li>Again, if you're fancy, season with salt and pepper and serve in a bowl.  If not, eat straight from the pot with a wooden spoon. </li>
        </ol>
